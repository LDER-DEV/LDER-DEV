Growing up as the child of Haitian immigrants, I learned the value of hard work and community. Working with my father at his driving school instilled in me the importance of perseverance and the rewards that come from working together.

Throughout my professional career, I've focused on building community through the arts. I've worked with local non-profit and CO-OP organizations to develop programs that promote artistic expression and cultural exchange.

As a software engineer, I'm excited to use my skills to continue to give back and nourish the communities that I come from. I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for creating positive change on a larger scale, and I'm eager to be a part of that transformation.
